Mapping with leaflet

This project utilizes API data from the USGS for all earthquakes within the last seven days to create a map of the data. The map includes several layers, street and topography base layers, a marker cluster layer, circles indicated the depth (color) and radius (magnitude) of the earthquakes, and a geometry of the tectonic plates. This visualization was created utilizing leaflet with javascript.
